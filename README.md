# etch-a-sketch
This webpage is like an Etch-A-Sketch where squares change color as the mouse hovers over them.  
Some features:  
  * Grids of squares generate dynamically.
  * There is a button to let user input side length (1-100) for the grid of squares.
  * When a mouse hovers onto a square, its color changes randomly.
  * Dimensions of the grid are preserved when window size is altered.
  * Squares are flex-wrapped to fill the grid.
